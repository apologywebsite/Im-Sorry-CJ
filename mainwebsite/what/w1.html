I’ve been trying to find a purpose in my life, or a sense of why I should stay and remain in this world. I’ve been trying to find myself, yet until now I still made no progress. Maybe I did and I just end up discrediting myself again, which would make more sense now that I think about it. I’ve helped a lot of people these past few months and all were glad and thankful that I did help them, yet somehow I still think that I didn’t do anything. </button>
