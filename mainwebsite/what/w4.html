I finally got the card that I’ve been struggling to find in the market, which is Helga Skittish Seer. I also paired it with a cute dino hippo companion, Keruga The Macrosage. My mom also said she’s going to buy me MTG commander decks in the US and ship them here along with the balikbayan box. If she manages to secure the Mardu Surge deck that you wanted, I can give it to you. I’ve also been travelling alone a lot lately, riding buses and trains to wherever I go. Which kinda explains why I’m not in my apartment most of the time. Speaking of, I got to play MTG in a LGS now. I do get anxious approaching people, but playing with them is fun and I get to meet new people. Also, the first guy I met was a pwd and only got 1 hand. I was speechless, as he destroyed me in a match. He also helped me choose a precon to purchase and I ended up buying one of the precons that I was planning to buy which is the Deep Clue Sea precon. It's a very fun deck and I got to wipe the board twice. </button>
