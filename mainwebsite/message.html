I always thought that I didn't deserve a second chance. Maybe I don't deserve another chance. But it would mean a lot to me, if we could reconcile, and be friends. The silence between both of us has been killing me, but I didn’t try contacting you because I don’t know if you even wanted to talk to me. But here I am now, after months of reflection and therapy. I’ll be here, waiting for you.
