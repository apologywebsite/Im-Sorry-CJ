I’m sorry I made you worry too much about me, that I became an inconvenience for you. I’m sorry I broke your heart, that I broke you emotionally, that I broke you mentally, that I’ve hurt you. Every time I hurt you, even unintentionally, I end up thinking that I should just stay away, because it hurts me so much to see you hurt, and knowing I was the reason, made me think I have no reason to be near you anymore, that I shouldn’t be with you anymore, because I always thought I’ve become abusive and the more I stay the more I’ll end up hurting you. I’m sorry for the times that I didn’t listen to you, for the times you didn’t feel heard, for the times you just wanted my attention. The attention that I couldn’t give you, that I ended up putting towards something else, instead of the person that I love.</button>
