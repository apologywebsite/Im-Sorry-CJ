I tried to give you everything you wanted, because it's the only way I know to make you happy. I know it sounds stupid, childish immature, for me to say that. I know it sounds like I’m just making excuses, or maybe I’m overthinking things again. But what I said is what I really felt in me, a feeling of regret, pain, and hatred towards myself. It may seem on the outside that I’m doing ok, but deep within, I will never forgive myself for everything that I have done wrong towards you. Because of it, I’m starting to think that I wasn’t really meant for you, if all I did to you was hurt you, ruined your life, and feel miserable because of me. I’m sorry if I sound like I’m just trying to make you feel bad for me, and I sure hope you won’t. Because I don’t want you to feel bad for something I entirely did to myself. I’m sorry, everything that went wrong.</button>
